# About

1) Golang can arguably be a good drop-in replacement for python for many
scripting-esque problems.

2) Using Golang results in significant performance gains for not much less readability and dev speed.

3) One point in favour of still using Python however is the 'easy to reach' builtin functions python provides.

go-builtins attempts to provide a similar set of helper functions that can speed up casual scripting.

If you have any ideas on useful things worth adding, please do suggest.
